# spatial_tools

A very rudimentary set of spatial tools aimed at raster processing for 
the Landscape Ecology Modeling, Mapping, and Analysis
([LEMMA](http://www.fsl.orst.edu/lemma)) team.

As of now, many of our tools are still sitting in SVN and we will slowly
refactor and add to this repository.
